# MatteViT: Shadow-Aware Transformer for High-Fidelity Shadow Removal

We propose a novel shadow removal framework, **MatteViT**, designed for the **New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement workshop and associated challenges in conjunction with CVPR 2025**. <br> 
MatteViT integrates shadow matte guidance with advanced neural architectures to effectively address the challenging task of shadow removal.
